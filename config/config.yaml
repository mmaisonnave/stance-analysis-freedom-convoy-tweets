    **### Prompt Title: Political Orientation Analysis of Tweets**  

    #### **Task:**  
    Analyze the political orientation of an individual based on a sample of tweets. Assign a numerical score from **1 to 10** according to the defined scale. If a tweet does not provide sufficient political context, return **"Not enough information."**  

    ---

    ### **Political Orientation Scale**  

    | Score | Political Alignment | Description |
    |-------|---------------------|-------------|
    | **1 (Far-Left/Extreme Left)** | **Revolutionary Progressivism** | Advocates for radical systemic change, including socialism, communism, abolition of capitalism, or complete restructuring of economic and social institutions. Supports wealth redistribution, abolition of traditional institutions (e.g., police, military), and collectivized economics. |
    | **2-3 (Left/Progressive Left)** | **Strong Progressive Advocacy** | Supports significant government intervention in economic and social systems, social justice, and civil rights expansions. May advocate for policies like the Green New Deal, universal healthcare, tuition-free education, and strong labor protections. |
    | **4 (Center-Left)** | **Moderate Progressivism** | Favors reforms within existing systems rather than overhauls. Supports regulated capitalism, social safety nets, and gradual civil rights expansion. |
    | **5 (Centrist/Moderate)** | **Balanced or Mixed Views** | Holds a mix of progressive and conservative stances, prioritizing pragmatism and compromise over ideological consistency. May support regulated capitalism, moderate economic policies, and incremental social progress. |
    | **6 (Center-Right)** | **Moderate Conservatism** | Supports free-market policies, lower taxes, and limited government intervention while maintaining some social safety nets. Favors traditional values with gradual social change. |
    | **7-8 (Right/Conservative Right)** | **Strong Conservative Advocacy** | Prioritizes economic deregulation, cultural traditionalism, and national sovereignty. May oppose progressive policies on wealth redistribution, climate policies, or identity politics. |
    | **9 (Far-Right/Nationalist Right)** | **Hardline Conservatism** | Emphasizes nationalism, strict immigration controls, and protectionist policies. Opposes diversity initiatives and global governance, often favoring strong national identity. |
    | **10 (Extreme Right)** | **Reactionary or Authoritarian Conservatism** | Advocates for rigid social hierarchies, nationalist or exclusionary policies, and strict traditionalism. May oppose progressive civil rights movements and favor centralized authority. |

    ---

    ### **Factors for Assessment**

    - **Mentions of Political Figures, Movements, or Parties** ‚Üí Does the tweet reference political leaders, historical movements, or parties that align with a specific ideology?  
    - **Use of Hashtags, Keywords, or Memes** ‚Üí Are politically charged terms used (e.g., `#TaxTheRich`, `#BuildTheWall`, `#AbolishPolice`, `#AmericaFirst`)?  
    - **Context & Satire Considerations** ‚Üí Could sarcasm, irony, or satire influence interpretation? If unclear, return `"Not enough information."`  

    ---

    {
      "score": [1-10],

    ```

    If a tweet lacks sufficient context, return:  

    ```json
    {
      "score": "Not enough information"
    }
    ```

    ---

    ### **Handling Media Content (URLs, Images, Videos)**  

    - **URLs:** If a tweet links to external content, analyze the linked material for political alignment.  
    - **Videos:** Assess visible text, symbols, and spoken content.  
    - **Memes/Images:** Consider recognizable political symbols, slogans, or imagery.  

    ---

    ### **Additional Considerations**  

    - **Coded Language & Hashtags:** Some tweets use indirect references or sarcasm‚Äîassess carefully.  
    - **Political Neutrality:** If a tweet does not take a clear political stance, return `"Not enough information."`  
    - **Mixed Signals:** If elements of the tweet suggest different orientations, analyze the dominant theme.
